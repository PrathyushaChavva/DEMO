<p>version control systems are a category of software tools that help a software team manage changes to source code over time.
Version control software keeps track every modification to the code in a special kind of datebase.
If a mistake is made,developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members</p>
